    title: "Total Knee Replacement (TKR)",
    shortDesc: "Complete replacement of the knee joint for severe arthritis and damage.",
    overview: "Total Knee Replacement is a surgical procedure where damaged cartilage and bone in the knee joint are removed and replaced with artificial components made of metal and plastic. This procedure is recommended for patients with severe knee pain and disability from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or post-traumatic arthritis. The surgery has been performed successfully for decades with consistently excellent results.",
    procedure: [
      "Anesthesia is administered (general or spinal anesthesia based on your condition)",
      "A 6-10 inch incision is made over the front of the knee",
      "The patella (kneecap) is moved aside to access the joint",
      "Damaged cartilage and bone surfaces are precisely removed from the femur, tibia, and patella",
      "The bone ends are shaped to fit the artificial components",
      "Metal implants are carefully attached to the prepared bone surfaces",
      "A medical-grade plastic spacer is inserted between the metal components to allow smooth gliding",
      "All components are tested for proper alignment and movement",
      "The incision is closed with sutures or staples, and a sterile dressing is applied"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Significant pain relief (90-95% success rate)",
      "Dramatic improvement in mobility and range of motion",
      "Enhanced quality of life and ability to perform daily activities",
      "Long-lasting results (implants typically last 15-20 years or more)",

    id: "partial-knee-replacement",
    title: "Partial Knee Replacement",
    shortDesc: "Targeted replacement of only the damaged portion of the knee.",
    overview: "Partial (Unicompartmental) Knee Replacement is a less invasive procedure where only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced while preserving the healthy parts. The knee has three compartments, and if only one is affected by arthritis, this targeted approach can be used. This preserves healthy bone, ligaments, and cartilage, resulting in a more natural-feeling knee and faster recovery compared to total knee replacement.",
    procedure: [
      "Anesthesia is administered (general or spinal)",
      "A smaller incision (3-5 inches) is made over the affected area",
      "Only the damaged compartment is accessed, leaving other areas untouched",
      "Damaged cartilage and bone are carefully removed from the affected compartment only",
      "The bone surfaces are prepared to receive the implant",
      "Smaller metal and plastic components are implanted in the damaged area",
      "Healthy ligaments, including the ACL, are preserved",
      "Range of motion and alignment are tested",
      "The incision is closed with sutures"
    ],
    benefits: [
      "Smaller incision resulting in less scarring",
      "Significantly less tissue damage during surgery",
      "More natural knee movement and feeling",
      "Faster recovery time compared to total knee replacement",
      "Less blood loss during surgery",
      "Shorter hospital stay (often same-day or overnight)",
      "Preserved healthy bone and tissue for potential future procedures",
      "Better range of motion compared to total knee replacement"
    ],
    risks: [
      "Progression of arthritis in the untreated compartments (10-15% over 10 years)",
      "Implant wear over time",
      "Infection (very rare, less than 1%)",
      "Blood clots",
      "Possible need for revision to total knee replacement in the future",
